        Parallel Execution: Nodes without dependencies are submitted for execution immediately. As each node completes, its output is stored, and the executor checks if dependent (consumer) nodes are ready to be executed (i.e., all their dependencies have completed). This allows for parallel execution where possible.

        Dynamic Parameter Passing: When executing a service, parameters (user_prompt and service_input) are dynamically passed based on the service method's signature. This flexible approach caters to different service requirements.

        Handling Multiple Dependencies: When a node has multiple dependencies, the outputs of all dependencies are collected into a list and passed as service_input. This approach assumes that services designed to accept inputs from multiple nodes can handle a list of inputs.
