def search_only(func):
    """A decorator for wrapping database search functions.

    This function takes as input another function ('func') and returns a new function that wraps the original one.
    The main purpose of this decorator is to apply some before and/or after processing to the function that it is decorating.

    It can be used to encapsulate operations that need to be performed before a search is made to the database,
    like opening a connection or logging, as well as operations that should be executed once the database search is completed
    (like closing the connection to the database).

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to be wrapped. This is typically a database search function.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        A new function that wraps the original one. This new function takes the same
        parameters as the original one and returns its result.

    Note
    ----
    - The output function (wrapper) applies the original function (func) to the provided arguments ('args' tuple and 'kwargs' dictionary),
      which means every single positional and keyword argument passed to it will actually be passed to the function being decorated.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> @search_only
    ... def my_search_function(query):
    ...     # Perform database search
    ...     # And return result.
    ...     pass

    Here, the function `my_search_function` is decorated with `search_only` function which will add pre-processing
    and/or post-processing steps to the execution of `my_search_function` when it's called.

        specific to the tenant. It then builds a query from the provided filter expression
        using the QueryBuilder. The fetched objects are returned along with their creation
        and last update time.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        filter_expression : dict
            The expression used to filter which objects will be queried. The expressed
            conditions must be in the form of a dictionary where the keys represent
            the property fields of the objects and the values specify the conditions
            for filtering. The conditions could include operators such as "=", ">=",
            "<=", etc. Nested conditions can be expressed using logical operators such as "and" and "or".

        Returns:
        -------
        QueryReturn

        Examples:
        --------

        Parameters
        ----------
        properties : Iterable (list, tuple, etc.)
            The list of tuples where each tuple consists of a string key representing property
            and the corresponding value to filter the Weaviate collection objects.
            e.g. [("document_type", "test_type"), ("source", "host/database")]

        match_type : str, optional (default = "like")
            The matching type to be used with the properties for filtering.
            It can hold following values:
            - "like": Provides a case-insensitive partial match for string throughout the filtered objects.

        Returns
        -------
        WeaviateObjectsHandler
            The result object that contains an aggregated count over all objects in

        Raises
        ------
        ConnectionError
            If there is an error in connecting to Weaviate.

        Notes
        -----
        - Filters are created in the form suitable for the Weaviate client SDK.
