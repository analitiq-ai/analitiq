      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to To answer the user query \"What is the average age of our customers?\", we will follow these steps: 1. Preprocess Data (NLP Service): Break down the query into individual components (keywords, entities, etc.) to better understand the user's intent. - Action Input: User Query - Instructions: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the user query and identify key elements such as \"average\", \"age\", \"customers\". 2. Identify Data Source (Data Catalog Service): Locate the relevant data sources required to answer the user's query. - Action Input: Preprocessed Query Components - Instructions: Search the data catalog for data sources that contain customer-related information, such as customer profiles or demographic data. 3. Extract Data (DataManager Service): Retrieve the required data from the identified sources, clean it, and format it for analysis. - Action Input: Identified Data Sources - Instructions: Use the DataManager service to run a pre-configured data pipeline that extracts the necessary customer data, cleans it, and formats it for analysis. 4. Perform Analysis (Analytics Service): Analyze the cleaned and formatted data to find insights that answer the user's query. - Action Input: Cleaned and Formatted Data - Instructions: Utilize the analytics service to calculate the average age of the customers by summing up the ages of all customers and dividing by the total number of customers. 5. Formulate Response (NLP Service): Craft a concise and informative response to the user based on the analysis results. - Action Input: Analysis Results -\n",
