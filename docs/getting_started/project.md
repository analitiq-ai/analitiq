# Project Configuration (`project.yml`) for Analitiq

## Overview

The `project.yml` file serves as the main configuration file for an Analitiq project. It must be located in the project's root directory. This file specifies various parameters that define the behavior and settings of your Analitiq application.
The file `project.yml` has all of your project data, such as where the logs are stored. 
Most importantly, `project.yml` defines where your custom Services are located so Analitiq can pick them up and use them to manage your data.

    services_dir: "custom_services"
    session_uuid_file: 'session_uuid.txt' # Where session identifier is being recorded. When session is reset, it is like beginning of a new chat topic and new log file will be created.
    target_path: "target"
    message_lookback: 5 # when LLM has no clue about users request, or users request relates to some item in chat history, how far back (in number of messages) should the LLM look in the current session chat log
